                    The Environmental Team of the Fifth Belgrade Gymnasium was founded in early 2022 by two friends keen on finding a solution for ongoing environmental issues. Our main objective was and still is raising awareness on the importance of everyday individual contribution to the creation of a more balanced and healthy environment. In search of realistic initiatives two High School students could start and follow through with, the idea of organising a cleaning action in Belgrade came to be and made perfect sense for our project. The idea was approved by the Students’ Parliament and the two of us dedicated most of our time to ensure sponsors, media outlets, and volunteers. Right before Earth Day 2022, on the 21st of April, 160 High School students from all over Belgrade gathered and volunteered for the much-needed cause, sending a message to the whole country it’s crucial for us to start taking action. The action was a great success and echoed greatly in the general public, with environmental teams of different High Schools being founded around the country.

                    The next cleaning action was organised on Children's Environmental Health Day on October 13th, 2022, cleaning the Danube promenade in downtown Belgrade, with 450 volunteers gathering around the idea. A huge increase in interest was noted in Belgrade and nationwide, with High School students from 13 different Serbian towns and cities applying to become local coordinators of the Team and an action simultaneously being held in Negotin, gathering 70 volunteers. Between now and then, we have organised multiple tribunes educating the youth on the importance of environmentally friendly behaviour, together with two bazaars tackling consumerism and finding a new use for second-hand items.

                    We’re currently working on a national cleaning project. We plan to enhance youth cooperation and participation, while simultaneously cleaning public spaces and shedding a light on the importance of taking care of the environment and providing High Schoolers with an opportunity to travel and network.
